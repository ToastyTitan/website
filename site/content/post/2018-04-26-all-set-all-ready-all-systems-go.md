## Getting started.

For the past few weeks, the team has been busy moving into our beautiful basement studio, getting to know each other, and getting a grip on what our game will be when we finish it in early June. The day-to-day work has consisted of designing the various aspects of our game and prototyping mechanics, art, and sounds and seeing what works as we want it to work. 

It's been full steam ahead and the team is a blast to work with. We might all be students, but the focus with which we work gives me a feeling of working in a start-up rather than a university group assignment. Neon Nemesis is now taking form, with gameplay features, art or sounds being added every single day.
